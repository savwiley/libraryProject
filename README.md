# Library: TOP JS Project

This project was made with Webpack & Firebase. Information about TOP's Library Project can be found [here](https://theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). However, after learning more about JS, I have gone back and added extra features to the project.

This new repo holds the current iteration of this app. If you would like to see the original repo with more history on the app's progress as well as the issue that lead to creating this new repo, please go [here](https://github.com/savwiley/library-project).
