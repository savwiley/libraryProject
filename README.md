# Library: TOP JS Project

This project was made with Webpack & Firebase. Information about TOP's Library Project can be found [here](https://theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). However, after learning more about JS, I have gone back and added extra features to the project.

# NOTICE
There was a problem with the original repostiory for this app. It was so bad, that I lost nearly everything. This new repo holds the current iteration of this app. If you would like to see the original repo with more history of this app, go [here](https://github.com/savwiley/library-project).

If anything, I learned the value of backing up git before I start debugging.

## Extra Features

- A universal library that holds book information on a Firebase server.

## Coming Soon
